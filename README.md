# Laravel Orchid CRUD

![Tests](https://github.com/orchidsoftware/crud/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)


## Introduction

Laravel Orchid has provided a unique experience for writing applications, but sometimes a simple CRUD needs to be done when it might seem overkill. Therefore, we have created a new package aimed at developers who want to quickly create a user interface for eloquent models with functions such as create, read, update, and delete.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require orchid/crud
```

## Usage

``` php
// ...
```

## Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
