## Introduction

<a href="https://orchid.software/" target="blank">Laravel Orchid</a> has provided a unique experience for writing applications. Still, sometimes a simple CRUD needs to be done when it might seem overkill. Therefore, we have created a new package aimed at developers who want to quickly create a user interface for eloquent models with functions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting.


You can describe the entire process using one file. And when you need more options, it's easy to switch to using the platform.
All fields, filters, and traits are compatible.

> This package is still under development.

## Installation

You can install the package using the –°omposer.
To do this, you need to install a new Composer repository in the `composer.json` file of your Laravel application.

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/orchidsoftware/crud.git"
    }
],
```

Next, add personal token to the config section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
"config": {
    "github-oauth": {
        "github.com": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
},
```

No token? Head to [settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Orchid+CRUD) to retrieve a token.

> If you don't want to store the token in your composer file, you can skip this step. When installing, Composer will ask for it on its own and save it to ".composer/auth.json". Or you can specify it yourself by running: `composer config -g github-oauth.github.com XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
 
Next, add `orchid/crud` to the require section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
"require": {
    "orchid/crud": "*"
},
```

After your `composer.json` file has been updated, run the composer update command in your console terminal:

```bash
composer update
```

## Defining Resources

Resources are stored in the `app/Orchid/Resources` directory of your application.
You may generate a new resource using the `orchid:resource` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan orchid:resource PostResource
```

The most basic and fundamental property of a resource is its `model` property. 
This property tells the generator which Eloquent model the resource corresponds to:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

/**
 * The model the resource corresponds to.
 *
 * @var string
 */
public static $model = Post::class;
```

Freshly created resources contain nothing. Don't worry, we'll add more fields to our resource soon.

## Expanding of Model

Many features of the Orchid platform relies on model customization. You can add or remove traits depending on your goals. But we will assume that you have set these for your model:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Orchid\Attachment\Attachable;
use Orchid\Filters\Filterable;
use Orchid\Screen\AsSource;

class Post extends Model
{
    use AsSource, Filterable, Attachable;
}
````


## Registering Resources

By default, all resources within the `app/Orchid/Resources` directory will automatically be registered.
You are not required to manually register them.


## Permissions Resources

Each resource contains a `permission` method. Which should return the string key that the user needs to access this resource. By default, all resources are available to every user.

```php
/**
 * Get the permission key for the resource.
 *
 * @return string|null
 */
public static function permission(): ?string
{
    return null;
}
```

For each registered resource in which the method returns a non-null value, a new permission is created. 

```php
/**
 * Get the permission key for the resource.
 *
 * @return string|null
 */
public static function permission(): ?string
{
    return 'private-post-resource';
}
```

It is necessary to give the right to manage it to the user.
To click on the profile in the left column, go to the system page, and then to the page with users, 
you can issue them a mandate or assign a role. After that, they will be displayed in the left menu.

## Defining Fields

Each resource contains a `fields` method. This method returns an array of fields, which generally extend the `Orchid\Screen\Field` class. To add a field to a resource, we can add it to the resource's `fields` method. Typically, fields may be created using their static `make` method. This method accepts several arguments; however, you usually only need to pass the field's name.


```php
use Orchid\Screen\Fields\Input;

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function fields(): array
{
    return [
        Input::make('title')
            ->title('Title')
            ->placeholder('Enter title here'),
    ];
}
```
In the package to generate CRUD, you can use the fields Orchid platform. Review [all available fields on the documentation site](https://orchid.software/en/docs/field/).


## Defining –°olumns

Each resource contains a `—Åolumns` method. To add a column to a resource, we can add it to the resource's `column` method. Typically, columns may be created using their static `make` method. 

```php
use Orchid\Screen\TD;

/**
 * Get the columns displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return TD[]
 */
public function columns(): array
{
    return [
        TD::set('id'),
        TD::set('title'),
    ];
}
```
The CRUD generation package is entirely based on the table layer. You can [read more about this on the documentation page](https://orchid.software/en/docs/layouts/table/).

## Defining Rules

Each resource contains a `rules` method. When submitting a create or update form, the data can be validated, which is described in the `rules` method:

``` php
/**
 * Get the validation rules that apply to save/update.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function rules(Post $model): array
{
    return [
        'slug' => [
            'required',
            Rule::unique(Post::class, 'slug')->ignore($model),
        ],
    ];
}
```

You can learn more on the Laravel [Validation page](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules).


## Defining Filters

TODO:

Each resource contains a `filters` method.

``` php
/**
 * Get the filters available for the resource.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function filters(): array
{
    return [];
}
```

To create a new filter, there is a command:

```bash
php artisan orchid:filter QueryFilter
```

This will create a class filter in the `app/Http/Filters` folder. To use filters in your own resource, you need:

```php
public function filters(): array
{
    return [
        QueryFilter::class
    ];
}
```

You can learn more on the Orchid [Filtration page](https://orchid.software/en/docs/filters/#natural-filter).

## Eager Loading

Suppose you routinely need to access a resource's relationships within your fields. In that case, it may be a good idea to add the relationship to the `with` property of your resource. This property instructs to always eager to load the listed relationships when retrieving the resource.

```php
 /**
 * Get relationships that should be eager loaded when performing an index query.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function with(): array
{
    return ['user'];
}
```

## Resource Events

Each resource has two methods that do the processing, `onSave` and `onDelete`. Each of them is launched when the event is executed, and you can change or supplement the logic:

``` php
/**
 * Action to create and update the model
 *
 * @param ResourceRequest $request
 * @param Model           $model
 */
public function onSave(ResourceRequest $request, Model $model)
{
    $model->forceFill($request->all())->save();
}

/**
 * Action to delete a model
 *
 * @param Model $model
 *
 * @throws Exception
 */
public function onDelete(Model $model)
{
    $model->delete();
}
```

## Localization

Resource names may be localized by overriding the `label` and `singularLabel` methods on the resource class:

``` php
/**
 * Get the displayable label of the resource.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function label()
{
    return __('Posts');
}

/**
 * Get the displayable singular label of the resource.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function singularLabel()
{
    return __('Post');
}
```

Action buttons and notifications can also be translated, for example:

```php
/**
 * Get the text for the create resource button.
 *
 * @return string|null
 */
public static function createButtonLabel(): string
{
    return __('Create :resource', ['resource' => static::singularLabel()]);
}

/**
 * Get the text for the create resource toast.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function createToastMessage(): string
{
    return __('The :resource was created!', ['resource' => static::singularLabel()]);
}
```
